## 🌟 Overview

The **Frontend** is a React-based single-page application that provides an intuitive, responsive interface for managing your job search. Built with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS + Ant Design, it covers the full job search lifecycle: tracking applications, comparing offers, managing interview availability, running AI career tools, and visualizing progress.

**Key Capabilities:**

- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize applications, offers, and availability with dynamic charts
- 🤖 **AI Career Suite**: JD matching, cover letter generation, negotiation advice, skill refinement, and custom widgets powered by your own provider config with encrypted backend key storage
- 🔐 **JWT Auth Flow**: Login, refresh, and protected-route bootstrapping now use Bearer tokens so the frontend can talk to a separate `*.vercel.app` backend without shared cookies
- 💰 **Offer Comparison**: Side-by-side compensation analysis with tax/COL/rent-adjusted "Diff vs Current" and weighted decision scoring
- 👤 **Experience Intelligence**: Rich work history management with internship earnings breakdowns, multi-phase schedules, team history, and linked-offer raise tracking
- 📅 **Calendar Views**: Weekly availability calendar with federal holiday detection and public booking links
- 📥 **Import/Export**: Bulk upload via CSV/XLSX plus full-fidelity Experience import/export in CSV, JSON, or XLSX formats (JSON recommended for logos + linked snapshots)

## ✨ Features

### 🏢 Application Tracker (`/applications`)

- Create, edit, delete applications with modal forms
- Status badges color-coded by stage (Applied, OA, Screen, Onsite, Offer, Rejected, Accepted, Ghosted)
- Filter by status and search by company/role
- Year filter with persisted state
- Bulk select → bulk lock / unlock / delete
- Company timeline modal for Applied → OA → phone → onsite → offer/reject stages with per-stage notes and document attachments
- Import from CSV/XLSX; export to CSV, JSON, XLSX
- Lock/unlock individual applications
- **⚡ Cover Letter Generator**: per-row button opens `CoverLetterModal` — paste optional JD, generate, auto-save

### 💎 Offer Comparison (`/offers`)

- **Interactive Bar Chart**: Recharts stacked chart showing TC breakdown (Base, Bonus, Equity, Sign-On, Benefits)
- **Offer Details Table**: Company, role, location, RTO badge, all salary components with after-tax breakdown, Total Comp, Adjusted Value, PTO/Holiday days, Diff vs Current
- **Decision Scorecard**: Weighted offer ranking across financial value and location, with advanced growth, WLB, brand, manager/team, and immigration signals scored only when filled
- **⚡ Negotiation Advisor**: per-row "Negotiate" button (non-current offers) opens `NegotiationAdvisorModal`:
  - Centered offer snapshot header (Base, Bonus, Equity/yr, Sign-On, PTO)
  - **Suggested Counter-Ask** — concrete numbers (base, sign-on, equity, PTO) with rationale
  - **Leverage Points** (green) — strengths to cite
  - **Talking Points & Scripts** (amber) — ready-to-use scripts
  - **Watch Out For** (red) — risks and cautions
  - Regenerate button; auto-saves result to localStorage with "Saved" indicator + "View Full Report" link

- **Add Current Job**: Quick baseline creation

### 🧠 Intelligence (`/ai-tools`, `/jd-reports`, `/negotiation-result/:id`, `/jd-report/:id`)

> AI features are configured in `Settings` → `AI Provider`. The endpoint/model are tied to your account, and the API key is stored encrypted on the backend.

Sidebar "Intelligence" tree groups all AI-generated outputs under one collapsible section:

- **JD Reports** (`/jd-reports`): Card list of all past JD evaluations with score badge, skill tags, lock/delete/rename. Uses `RowActions` + `BulkActionHeader` + `PageActionToolbar`.
- **JD Report Detail** (`/jd-report/:id`): Full standalone page with progress ring, strengths/gaps columns, resume evidence gaps, supported JD keywords, bullet rewrite suggestions, best matching experience evidence, recommendations, and PDF download. Top bar uses `BulkActionHeader`.
- **Cover Letters** (`/ai-tools?tab=cover-letters`): Auto-saved whenever a cover letter is generated from the Applications page. Card list with view modal (serif font, Copy to Clipboard), rename, lock/delete, bulk actions, CSV/JSON export.
- **Negotiation Results** (`/ai-tools?tab=negotiation-results`): Auto-saved whenever the Negotiation Advisor runs. Card list showing offer snapshot chips, advice summary counts, lock/delete, bulk actions, CSV/JSON export, and "View Full Report" link.
- **Negotiation Result Detail** (`/negotiation-result/:id`): Full standalone page mirroring `JDReport` layout — offer snapshot, Suggested Counter-Ask panel, Leverage Points, Talking Points & Scripts, Watch Out For. Top bar uses `BulkActionHeader`.

### 📄 Document Vault (`/documents`)

- File upload with type classification (Resume, Cover Letter, Portfolio, Other)
- Versioning: version badge, version history modal, upload new version while preserving chain
- Authenticated open/download flow: the UI fetches document bytes with the user's JWT, so private Blob-backed files still open correctly from a separate frontend domain
- Optional link to an application
- Lock/unlock, year filter, export, delete all (locked preserved)

### 👤 Experience (`/experience`)

- Full CRUD for work experience entries (title, company, dates, description, skills)
- Skills auto-extracted by backend fallback logic, then AI-refined after save when an API key is configured in Settings
- Inline skill tag editing
- JD Matcher modal accessible from this page; reports now include fit scoring plus resume tailoring suggestions
- **Employment type badges** — dynamically driven by user-configured types from Settings (10 color options); first type (Full-time) hidden by default
- **Exact duration display** — all date ranges and tenure stats show `(N days)` alongside human-readable duration
- **Company logo upload** — upload or remove a company logo per experience entry; displayed as an avatar on the card; persisted through the backend upload API and stored in Vercel Blob on hosted deployments
- **Raise History Modal** — accessible from experience entries linked to an offer; log raise events (date, type, before/after base/bonus/equity) with optional label and notes; persisted on the linked Offer record
- **Team History / Team Norms** — internship and full-time roles can track structured team history in a dedicated modal
- **Internship Compensation Breakdown** — per-role earnings breakdown with editable hourly inputs, overtime configuration, manual total hours, and linked schedule-phase management
- **Overall Earnings Panels** — combined Full-Time and Internship summaries with breakdown modals; internship totals now include overtime pay across tracked roles
- **Schedule Phases** — split an internship into multiple schedule phases with per-phase rate, schedule, overtime, and total-hours inputs
- **Quick Import Weekly Schedule** — paste weekly timesheet-style text into the Schedule Phases modal to auto-generate merged phases from dates, hours, and overtime rows
- **Experience Import / Export** — toolbar supports import/export for the entire Experience page; JSON round-trips the richest payload, including logos, linked offer/application snapshots, team history, and schedule phases

### 📅 Availability & Events

- **Availability** (`/`): Weekly calendar with availability text generation, federal holiday integration, event badges, date navigation, public booking card
- **Events** (`/events`): Create/edit/delete interview events; link to applications; timezone display; event type tags
- **Holidays** (`/holidays`): Federal + custom holiday management; group multi-day collections; ignore specific holidays; **custom tabs** defined in Settings (e.g., "Inauspicious Days") for organizing holidays beyond the built-in Custom/Federal split; tab-aware bulk edit with "Leave unchanged" sentinel to avoid accidental tab wipes
- **⚡ Conflict Radar**: `NotificationBell` refreshes unresolved conflicts, upcoming events, and task deadlines through the standard API flow, which keeps the UI compatible with local dev, Docker, and Vercel deployments

### 📊 Analytics (`/analytics`)

- **Availability Analytics**: Meeting/interview volume and duration tracking
- **Job Hunt Analytics**: Application funnel and outcome visualization
- **Custom Widget Engine**: Natural language queries (e.g., "rejections this month", "events by category") — common queries resolve locally and free-form queries send a frontend-built data summary through the authenticated backend AI relay
- **Drag-and-Drop Dashboard**: Reorder and save widget layouts with `dnd-kit`

### ✅ Action Items (`/tasks`)

- Kanban-style task board with TODO / IN_PROGRESS / DONE columns
- Drag-and-drop reordering within and between columns
- Priority levels (Low, Medium, High) and due dates
- **Weekly Review panel** — sidebar card showing current week's application activity, interviews done, and next actions; auto-refreshes on tab focus and task updates

### ⚙️ Settings (`/settings`)

- **Availability & Job Hunt Settings**: work hours, work days, default event duration, buffer time, primary timezone, ghosting threshold, default event category
- **AI Provider**: configure an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, model, and personal API key for cover letters, JD matching, negotiation advice, and analytics widgets; the key is stored encrypted on the backend and never re-shown after save
- **Multiple Availability Time Ranges**: define non-contiguous availability windows per day (e.g., 11am–12pm and 2pm–5pm) via an add/remove range UI; falls back to the legacy single start/end time when no ranges are configured
- **Data Management**: export all data as ZIP (JSON, CSV, or Excel)
- **Manage Categories**: add/edit/delete event categories with color + icon; per-item lock (persisted to DB via PATCH); section-level lock
- **Employment Types**: fully configurable employment types used across the Experience page — add/edit/delete with label, auto-generated slug value, and 10-color swatch picker; per-item lock; section-level lock; saved with Settings
- **Holiday Manager Tabs**: define custom tabs (name → auto-generated ID) that appear as tabs in the Holiday Manager; per-item lock; section-level lock; saved with Settings

### 🔐 Authentication

- **Bearer token bootstrapping**: the app restores auth state from stored access/refresh tokens and automatically refreshes expired access tokens before retrying protected API calls
- **Zero-domain-cost deployment support**: works with separate Vercel frontend/backend projects on `*.vercel.app` without depending on shared session cookies

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- npm

### Installation

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API/media calls to `http://localhost:8000` when `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is unset.

For deployed environments:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then set:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-project.vercel.app/api
# Optional if uploaded files are served from a different origin
VITE_MEDIA_BASE_URL=https://your-api-project.vercel.app
```

For local backend startup, copy `api/.env.development.example` to `api/.env.development` before running Django or Docker Compose.

If backend models changed, run backend migrations before using the app:
```bash
cd ../api && python manage.py migrate
```

### Vercel Deployment

Frontend deploys as its own Vercel project:

1. Set the Root Directory to `frontend`
2. Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-project.vercel.app/api` in Vercel Project Settings, replacing the host with your own backend deployment
3. Optionally add `VITE_MEDIA_BASE_URL`
4. Deploy normally; `frontend/vercel.json` already rewrites SPA routes back to `index.html`

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Output in `dist/`.

### Run Linter
```bash
npm run lint
```
